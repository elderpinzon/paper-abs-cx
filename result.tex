\section{Results}\label{sec:result}
The measured $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ are presented in Table \ref{tbl:result} and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:result} with statistical and systematic error bars as a function of pion momentum, compared with the results from previous experiments \cite{Bellotti1973,Ashery2,Bellotti1973_2,Jones}. Our results are in agreement with previous experiments, but we have extended the momentum region over which the data is presented. As summarized in Table \ref{table:systematics}, the total error is $\sim$9.5\% for $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sim$18\% for $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$, except for the $p_{\pi}$ = 216.6 MeV$/c$ data set.

In addition, we provide correlation and fractional covariance coefficients for the 5 $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and 5 $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ measured data points in Fig. \ref{fig:covariance}. The statistical uncertainties were included as an uncorrelated diagonal matrix. There are positive correlations within the $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and 5 $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ measurements, and negative correlations across them, as is expected from the subtraction method used. This is the first time that a correlation matrix is published for a pion inelastic cross section measurement. It is expected to provide additional insight to the proper modeling and tuning of hadron-nucleus inelastic interactions.

\section{Summary}
To summarize, we obtained $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ for positive pions in carbon nuclei at five incident momenta between 201.6 MeV$/c$ to 295.1 MeV$/c$. A covariance matrix for the 10 measured data points was produced. This result will be an important input to existing models such as \textsc{Geant4} or \textsc{NEUT} to constrain sub-GeV pion interactions.
