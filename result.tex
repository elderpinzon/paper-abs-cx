\section{Results}\label{sec:result}
The measured $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ are presented in Table \ref{tbl:result} and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:result} with statistical and systematic error as a function of pion momentum, compared with the results from previous experiments \cite{Bellotti1973,Ashery2,Bellotti1973_2,Jones1993} where the absorption and charge exchange cross sections were explicitly measured. Our results are in agreement with previous experiments, but we have extended the momentum region over which the data is presented. As summarized in Table \ref{table:systematics}, the total error is $\sim$9.5\% for $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sim$18\% for $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$, except for the $p_{\pi}$ = 216.6 MeV$/c$ data set.

\subsection{Fractional covariance and correlation coefficients}
We provide the fractional covariance and correlation coefficients for the 5 $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and 5 $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ measured data points in the matrix in Fig. \ref{fig:covariance}. The diagonal and lower triangle of the matrix show the fractional covariance $(\mathrm{Sign}(V_{ij})*\sqrt{V_{ij}})$, where $V_{ij} = (\Delta\sigma_{i}\Delta\sigma_{j})/(\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j})$, and $\sigma_{k}$ and $\Delta\sigma_{k}$ are the nominal cross sections and their systematic shift, respectively. The upper triangle of the matrix shows the correlation coefficients.
The statistical uncertainties were included as an uncorrelated diagonal matrix. There are positive correlations within the $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ measurements, and negative correlations across them, as is expected from the subtraction method used. This is the first time that a correlation matrix is published for a pion inelastic cross section measurement.
%\st{It is expected to provide additional insight to the proper modeling and tuning of hadron-nucleus inelastic interactions.}

\section{Summary}
We obtained $\sigma_{\mathrm{ABS}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{CX}}$ for positive pions on carbon nuclei at five incident momenta between 201.6 MeV$/c$ to 295.1 MeV$/c$. A covariance matrix for the 10 measured data points was produced. This result will be an important input to existing models such as \textsc{Geant4} or \textsc{NEUT} to constrain sub-GeV pion interactions.
