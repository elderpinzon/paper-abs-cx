\section{\label{sec:selection}Event selection}
The event selection described in \cite{duet} used the PIA$\nu$O detector to identify events with no $\pi^{+}$ in the final state which are consistent with ABS+CX final states. As mentioned, for the analysis presented in this paper the selection was extended by using information from the downstream detector, CEMBALOS, to identify photons following a CX interaction. 

%An illustration of 
A simulated CX event is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:event}. The upstream horizontal (red) track represents a $\pi^{+}$ interacting in the PIA$\nu$O detector. As it undergoes a CX interaction two protons (black) and a $\pi^{0}$ are produced. The $\pi^{0}$ subsequently decays into two photons (blue). The forward-going photon travels to CEMBALOS where it converts into $e^{+}$$e^{-}$ pairs and deposits charge in the scintillating material.

The forward-going photon is identified in CEMBALOS as it produces $e^{+}$-$e^{-}$ pairs (purple, magenta) and hits are recorded in the scintillating material.}

\subsection{PIA$\nu$O upstream selection}
The PIA$\nu$O detector track reconstruction algorithm used charge deposition information to reconstruct and identify charged particles in the detector and to identify an interaction vertex within a defined fiducial volume (FV). A detailed description can be found in Sec. III of \cite{duet}. A summary of the upstream selection criteria follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Good incident $\pi^{+}$\\}
This selection criterion is threefold: firstly, an incident $\pi^{+}$ was selected using time-of-flight (TOF) and Cherenkov light information. Secondly, a straight track, normal to the incident plane, leaving hits in the first 5 layers was required. Thirdly, this incident track was required to enter a defined fiducial volume (FV).
\item {\bf Vertex inside the FV\\}
Events with pion interactions were selected by requiring a reconstructed vertex inside the FV.  A vertex was defined as the intersection of reconstructed tracks. This removed through-going pion events, as well as small-angle pion scattering events.
\item {\bf No $\pi^{+}$ final track\\}
Reconstructed tracks exiting the interaction vertex were classified into ``proton-like" and ``pion-like" tracks using an angle-dependent cut on the deposited charge, $dQ/dx$. Events with no ``pion-like'' tracks in the final state were selected.
\end{enumerate}
The number of selected ABS+CX events, efficiency, and purity for each momentum setting can be found in \cite{duet}. About 7000 events were selected at each momentum setting, other than the shortened 216.6 MeV$/c$ momentum run, which produced only 1800 events. The efficiency and purity of the selection, $\sim$79\% and $\sim$73\%, respectively, were similar for all 5 momentum settings.
%There were $\sim$7000 selected events in data  for each momentum setting after these criteria were applied with a $\sim$79\% efficiency to select ABS+CX events occurring inside the FV. The purity was estimated to be $\sim$73\%. The main backgrounds were $\pi^{+}$ elastic and quasi-elastic scatterings. This selection was used to extract $\sigma{_\mathrm{ABS+CX}}$ in \cite{duet}.

\subsection{CEMBALOS selection}
Charge deposition information from CEMBALOS was used to identify CX interactions occurring in PIA$\nu$O. The main goal was to tag one of the photons from the decay of a $\pi^0$ by identifying the corresponding electromagnetic shower in CEMBALOS. The limited angular coverage ($\sim0.53 sr$) of CEMBALOS imposed the largest efficiency loss. The selection criteria were as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Veto cut\\}
Charged particles in CEMBALOS left a signal in the scintillator material. Fig. \ref{fig:veto} shows the distribution of the position of the most upstream hit in CEMBALOS for each event. Each bar represents a scintillation plane. A veto cut on the first XY modules was applied to remove most of the charged particle backgrounds, such as low-angle $\pi^+$ scatters and protons from ABS events.

Each bar represents an XY module. Topologies contributing less than 1\% are not plotted.}
 \label{fig:veto}
\end{figure}
   
\item{\bf Hit Charge vs. Multiplicity\\}
The remaining backgrounds after the veto cut are produced by neutrons from ABS events and nuclear de-excitation $\gamma$-rays. Fig. \ref{fig:nhits} shows the distribution of the number of hits (multiplicity) in CEMBALOS. A minimum of five hits was required to reduce background from these sources. Fig. \ref{fig:nhitsvsCharge} shows the CEMBALOS hit charge vs. multiplicity distribution after applying the veto cut. A diagonal cut in this plane was applied to further reduce the remaining background of neutrons from ABS.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Selection purities and efficiencies}
The numbers of selected events for each momentum setting after the PIA$\nu$O and CEMBALOS selections were applied are summarized in Table \ref{tbl:short_event_summary} for data ($N_{\mathrm{Data}}$) and  \textsc{Geant4} MC (split into signal $N_{\mathrm{CX}}^{\mathrm{G4}}$ and background $N_{\mathrm{BG}}^{\mathrm{G4}})$. There are $\sim$100 events in data after the event selection, except for the 216.6 MeV$/c$ setting. The efficiencies and purities to select CX events which occurred inside the FV were around $\sim6\%$ and $\sim90\%$ respectively.  The efficiencies to select events which occurred inside the FV and had at least one of the CX photons in the direction of CEMBALOS were estimated to be $\sim30\%$.
