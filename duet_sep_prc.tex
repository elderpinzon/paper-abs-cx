\begin{abstract}

The DUET Collaboration reports the separate measurement of the absorption and charge exchange cross sections of positively charged pions with carbon nuclei for the momentum range 201.6 MeV$/c$ to 295.1 MeV$/c$. A scintillator fiber detector with interspersed lead was located downstream of the interaction point and was used to identify forward going photons from $\pi^{0}$ decays. The uncertainties for absorption and charge exchange are $\sim$9.5\% and $\sim$18\%, respectively. The results are in agreement with previous experiments and a covariance matrix for the 10 data points measured is reported. These measurements will be used as input for tuning existing nuclear cascade models and to constrain pion nuclear final state interactions and secondary interactions in neutrino generators.
